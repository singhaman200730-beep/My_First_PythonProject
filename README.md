# My_First_PythonProject
Quick Mart – Grocery Bill Generator with GST
A simple, clean, and beginner-friendly Python project
Finance & Retail Domain Mini Project – CSE Python Course

About This Project
This is my first complete Python project, built entirely from scratch after completing the Python course at VIT Bhopal.

I have used every concept we learned throughout the semester – variables, data types, loops, conditions, lists, dictionaries, f-strings, string formatting, datetime module, and clean code structure – all in one real-world application.

No code was copied from the internet. Everything was written using only the topics taught in class and self-practice.

Why I Chose a Finance/Retail Project
I wanted to build something practical and relatable. A grocery billing system is used every day by millions of people in India. This project helped me understand:
- Real GST calculation
- Shopping cart logic
- Clean bill formatting
- Professional output that looks like actual store receipts

It also makes a strong impression during placements and interviews because it shows I can create useful, real-life software.

Concepts Applied from VIT Bhopal Python Syllabus
- Dictionary to store menu items
- List and append() for shopping cart
- while and for loops
- if-else for input validation
- f-strings and advanced formatting for aligned output
- datetime module for current date and time
- Proper comments and readable code

Future Scope
In the next semester, I plan to convert this into a full GUI application

Thank you to the Python faculty at VIT Bhopal for teaching concepts so clearly.  
This project is proof that whatever was taught in class has been properly understood and applied.

Feel free to fork, star, or use this project for your own submission (just give a small credit).

Made with dedication by a VIT Bhopal CSE student
